FoodEase allows users to post their favorite restaurants and find new restaurants by comparing the restaurants liked by users with similar taste.

In order to suggest restaurants for an individual user, FoodEase compares the restaurants liked by people that like the same restaurants as said user. The model gives more weight to other users that have multiple restaurants in common with the current user.

In order to suggest similar restaurants when looking at a restaurantâ€™s page, FoodEase finds the most liked restaurants by users that liked the restaurant being viewed.

The primary way to add restaurants to the app is through searching the Yelp API. This helps homogenize the data as much as possible and avoid users creating invalid restaurants
. For now, I am allowing users to add restaurant info manually as well, something I will probably remove eventually.
